<h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>

<p>  This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.
</p>
  <p>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.</lp>

 <h2> Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)  </li>
    <li>175g of tahini
   <li> 6 sundried tomatoes
   <li> Half a red pepper
   <li> A pinch of cayenne pepper
   <li> 1 clove of garlic
   <li> A dash of olive oil
</ul>
 <h2> Instructions</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely
    <li>Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely
    <li>Add all the ingredients into a food processor
    <li>Process all the ingredients into a paste
    <li>If you want a coarse <b>"chunky"</b> hummus, process it for a short time
    <li>If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time
</ol>
  <p>For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you. </p>

 <h2> Storage</h2>

 <p> Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it. </p>


  <em>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</em>
